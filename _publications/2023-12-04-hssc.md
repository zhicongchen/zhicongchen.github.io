## Abstract

The users of the Dark Web require a secure and highly anonymous environment to exchange information while protecting their online privacy, which presents a privacy dilemma. This paper examines the digital footprints of user behavior on the three most popular cryptomarket forums on the Dark Web, namely Silk Road 1, Silk Road 2, and Agora. The results indicate that users who engage in more conversations and employ a wider range of vocabulary are more likely to discontinue their participation on the forum. Intriguingly, no significant relationship is found between network characteristics and user engagement. These findings emphasize that the risk of exposure within anonymous communities primarily stems from the potency of information rather than social connections, which sheds light on the privacy dilemma inherent in the Dark Web and provides deeper insights into the online user behavior surrounding anonymity-granting technologies on the Internet.
