I currently work as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Communications and New Media](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/cnm/) at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). Previously, I taught and conducted research at Nanjing University, my alma mater, where I gained valuable experience in research management, curriculum design as well as mentoring graduate and undergraduate students. 

I received my Ph.D. in Communication in 2022 from the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (CityU), where I was intellectually nurtured within the [Web Mining Laboratory](http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/), founded and coordinated by the esteemed Chair Professor of Computational Social Science and ICA Fellow [Prof. Jonathan J. H. Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q41vFFQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/com). A Computational Social Scientist in Communication by training, with over a decade of experience conducting computational social science research at the intersection of digital media, data science, and cultural analysis, I specialize in text-as-data methods, computational modeling, and large-scale digital datasets, with applications to online safety, information dynamics, and social change.

My research have appeared in top communication and interdisciplinary journals such as *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications*, *American Psychologist*, *New Media & Society*, *Journal of Information Technology & Politics*, *Chinese Journal of Communication*, *International Journal of Business Communication*, and *Communication and the Public*. These works span topics from anonymity technologies and privacy dilemmas to cultural value change in China. With a strong background in computational communication, digital methods, and cross-cultural research,  I aim to advance both theory and practice in understanding how digital technologies reshape social life.
