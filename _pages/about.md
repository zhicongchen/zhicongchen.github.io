I currently work as an Assistant Professor in Computational Social Science at the [School of Journalism and Communication](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/en9/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm) (NJU), where I am a core member of the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/). 

I earned my Ph.D. in Communication in 2022 from the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (CityU), where I was intellectually nurtured within the [Web Mining Laboratory](http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/), founded and coordinated by the esteemed Chair Professor of Computational Social Science and ICA Fellow [Prof. Jonathan J. H. Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q41vFFQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/com). Throughout my graduate studies, I received rigorous interdisciplinary training from both social scientists and network scientists, which laid a strong foundation for my development as a computational social scientist.

My doctoral research examined the socio-technical impact of anonymous communication technologies through the lens of computational social science. This interdisciplinary approach has equipped me with the methodological expertise to apply computational tools effectively to social science inquiries. My research has resulted in peer-reviewed publications in leading journals such as *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications*, *American Psychologist*, *New Media & Society*, *Chinese Journal of Communication*, *International Journal of Business Communication*, and *Communication and the Public*.

Through my continued research and active engagement in the field, I remain attuned to the evolving landscape of computational methods and their transformative role in communication studies. By integrating advanced techniques in natural language processing and network analysis, I investigate cultural dynamics, social behaviors, and public sentiment. This expertise enables me to contribute novel insights and innovative approaches to both the departmentâ€™s research agenda and its teaching mission, fostering a more dynamic and interdisciplinary environment for communication scholarship.
