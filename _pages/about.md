I develop computational methods and data-driven approaches to study **online safety**, **social sensing**, and **multilingual text mining**. My work combines natural language processing, network analysis, and data mining to measure information risk, behavior, and discourse across digital environments, from anonymous and underground ecosystems to mainstream social media. I build reproducible data pipelines and analytical frameworks for large-scale datasets to provide rigorous empirical evidence for cybersecurity, platform governance, and the societal impacts of digital systems.

My research is organized around three interconnected themes. First, I study **privacy and security in decentralized and anonymous systems**, applying text mining and network analysis to examine how anonymity tools like Tor are adopted and how information risk is distributed across platforms. Second, I investigate **social sensing and behavioral analytics for digital resilience**, using panel data and machine learning techniques to quantify how platform use is associated with behavioral patterns and how emotion dynamics in online discourse are associated with collective action. Third, I develop **multilingual NLP and text mining for cultural and geopolitical analytics**, training diachronic embedding models on large-scale corpora spanning decades to detect and measure long-term social and cultural shifts.

My work has appeared in *EPJ Data Science*, *New Media & Society*, *American Psychologist*, *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (Nature Portfolio)*, and other peer-reviewed venues. I received my Ph.D. from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) in 2022, where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaofan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=77urMs4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Jonathan J. H. Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q41vFFQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Web Mining Laboratory](http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/). I hold a master's degree from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) (2018) and a B.Eng. in Software Engineering from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/) (2016).
