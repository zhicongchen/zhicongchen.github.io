I study social dynamics and consequences of emerging media technologies, with focus on **online safety**, **digital resilience**, and **cultural analytics**. Using computational methods and large-scale data, my work investigates how adverse information ecosystems emerge in digital environments and how individuals and communities navigate them. I aim to bridges **communication research** and **computational social science**, drawing on text-as-data methods, network analysis, and computational modeling to address pressing questions about technology's impact on society.

My research is organized around three interconnected themes. First, I study **online safety in digital media platforms**, examining how technologies such as the Tor network reshape information behavior and privacy practices. Second, I investigate **digital resilience in emerging media technologies**, focusing on how people and communities adapt to adverse information environments and the conditions that support more resilient responses during crises. Third, I advance **cultural analytics**, using diachronic word embeddings and NLP to trace long-term cultural change, such as the rise of individualism in China, across decades of printed text.

My work has appeared in *New Media & Society*, *American Psychologist*, *EPJ Data Science*, *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (Nature Portfolio)*, *Chinese Journal of Communication*, *Journal of Information Technology & Politics* and other peer-reviewed venues. I received my Ph.D. in Computational Communication from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) in 2022, where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaofan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=77urMs4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Jonathan J. H. Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q41vFFQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Web Mining Laboratory](http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/). I hold an M.A. in Computational Communication from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) (2018) and a B.Eng. in Software Engineering from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/) (2016).
