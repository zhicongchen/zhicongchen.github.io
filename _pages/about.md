I currently hold the position of Assistant Research Fellow (a.k.a. Research Assistant Professor) at the [School of Journalism and Communication](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/en9/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm) (**NJU**). Within this role, I am actively involved as a core member of the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/). 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Communication in 2022 from the [Web Mining Laboratory](http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/), founded and coordinated by the esteemed ICA Fellow [Prof. Jonathan J. H. Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q41vFFQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/com), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (**CityU**). Throughout my graduate studies, I received comprehensive training from interdisciplinary scholars (e.g., social scientists and network scientists), which equipped me with the skills and knowledge to become a proficient **computational social scientist**. My scholarly contributions have been recognized through the publication of peer-reviewed research articles in prestigious social science journals, such as **New Media & Society**, **Humanities and Social Sciences Communications**, **American Psychologist**, and **Chinese Journal of Communication**.
