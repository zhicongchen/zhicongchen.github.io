I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Communications and New Media at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/cnm/). My work examines the social consequences of emerging media technologies, with particular emphasis on online safety, digital resilience, and cultural analytics.

Prior to NUS, I worked as an Assistant Professor at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), after earning a Ph.D. in Communication from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) in 2022, a master's degree in Journalism and Communication from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) in 2018, and a B.Eng. in Software Engineering from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/) in 2016.

## Research Interests

- Online safety in digital media ecosystems
- Digital resilience in emerging media technologies
- Cultural analytics of historical texts
- Computational methods for communication research

My research appears in leading peer-reviewed journals such as *New Media & Society*, *EPJ Data Science*, *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications*, *American Psychologist*, and *Journal of Information Technology & Politics*.
