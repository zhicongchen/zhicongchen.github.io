## Course Overview

From Instagram and TikTok to the use of visuals in news stories, the contemporary media environment is increasingly visual. This course provides systematic training in studying and researching visual culture in contemporary media environments. Combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches, the course introduces students to a range of methodological tools such as visual ethnography, content analysis, and computational multimodal analysis. By the end of the semester, students will be able to develop a mixed-method project to visual data and present findings in both academic and applied contexts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Apply** qualitative methods (semiotic, discourse, ethnographic) to interpret and analyze diverse visual materials, including images, films, videos, and digital media
2. **Implement** basic quantitative and computational techniques (human coding, content analysis, feature extraction, clustering) for analyzing visual datasets
3. **Design** and conduct a small-scale mixed-method visual project that integrates cultural interpretation with empirical analysis
4. **Evaluate** and demonstrate ethical awareness and reflexivity in collecting, analyzing, and presenting visual data
5. **Communicate** visual research findings clearly and effectively in written, oral, and visual formats

## Prerequisites

No formal prerequisite. Advisory: AR2225 Reading Visual Images (or VCU2101 Understanding Visual Culture) is recommended before this methods-heavy course.

## Level

Undergraduate

## Institution

Department of Communications and New Media, National University of Singapore

## Group Project

The group project focuses on mapping cultural representations and diachronic changes in Singapore's visual heritage, using the **National Library Singapore Digitized Images** dataset (via [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/)). Students adopt a mixed-methods framework integrating qualitative interpretation with computational analysis to trace how visual cultures evolve across historical and institutional contexts.

- **Weeks 1–2** — Formulate a cultural research question about visual change in Singapore
- **Weeks 3–5** — Close visual and contextual readings of selected images
- **Weeks 6–9** — Quantitative and computational analysis of visual metadata and temporal patterns
- **Weeks 10–12** — Apply AI/LLMs for coding and annotation, with critical reflection on methodology and ethics
