The story is partly true. But there is a counter-story, less comfortable and less often told, in which the same platforms gradually contract our world — narrowing who we talk to, what we encounter, where we go, and how we feel about events far from our immediate experience. This project investigates that contraction: how ICT use restructures the rhythms and repertoires of everyday life, and what those changes mean when society faces moments of genuine crisis.</p> <figure> <picture> <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8088451/pexels-photo-8088451.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Social media use" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Digital platforms have become the primary infrastructure of social life — shaping attention, emotion, and collective action at a scale and speed no prior medium could match. </div> <h2 id="behaviour-cocoon-and-daily-life">Behaviour Cocoon and Daily Life</h2> <p>The concept of the “behaviour cocoon” (行为茧房) builds on — and goes beyond — Cass Sunstein’s influential idea of the information cocoon. Sunstein worried that the internet would expose people only to ideas they already agreed with. The behaviour cocoon describes something more pervasive: the tendency of algorithmically curated platforms to narrow not just <em>what we read</em> but <em>what we do</em>. As recommendation systems optimise for engagement by surfacing content tailored to individual preference, the reinforcing loop extends from screens into the physical world. The places people visit, the social contacts they maintain, the activities they pursue — all can gradually converge toward a shrinking set of well-worn routines. The world becomes more personalised and, in the most literal sense, smaller.</p> <p>To test this, we tracked 2,400 Chinese social media users across four survey waves over 18 months — a panel design that allows us to observe change over time within individuals rather than simply comparing different people. Behavioural diversity was operationalised as an entropy-based index capturing the variety of daily activities: places visited, social contacts engaged, content types consumed. The question was straightforward: does how you use your phone predict how varied your life becomes?</p> <p>The answer upends the familiar screen-time debate. The culprit is not duration but mode. Passive scrolling — through short-video feeds, algorithmically curated timelines, recommendation-driven content streams — has a strong, consistent negative effect on behavioural diversity. Active use — messaging friends, commenting on posts, creating content — has a weak positive effect. The most damaging pattern is heavy multi-platform passive consumption: users who scroll across several apps without actively engaging show the sharpest contraction in the variety of their daily lives. Two findings stand out as particularly counterintuitive. First, younger users — the supposedly digital-native generation — show <em>faster</em> cocoon formation than older ones, not slower. Second, users in smaller cities, often assumed to have less diverse lives to begin with, actually cocooned faster than their metropolitan counterparts. Algorithmic personalisation, it seems, is an equal-opportunity narrower.</p> <h2 id="emotion-and-action-in-crisis">Emotion and Action in Crisis</h2> <p>The behaviour cocoon is a slow phenomenon — a gradual drift across months and years that people rarely notice happening. But digital media also shapes behaviour under conditions of acute urgency, and understanding that dynamic matters enormously. When disaster strikes — floods, earthquakes, pandemics — social media becomes the primary channel through which people learn what is happening, decide how to respond, and coordinate collective action. The question is whether the emotional character of that discourse helps or hinders.</p> <p>Crisis communication has always faced this tension. Emotionally charged content captures attention and motivates engagement in ways that calm, informational content cannot. But not all emotions are equally good at motivating <em>productive</em> action. Fear and despair may provoke paralysis rather than protective behaviour. Outrage may direct energy toward blame rather than response. Solidarity and sympathy, by contrast, may generate exactly the kind of sustained, other-directed motivation that disaster response requires. Which emotions, amplified through which platforms, actually move people to act?</p> <p>We examined this question using large-scale social-media discourse from major crisis contexts. Posts were coded for emotional tone and action orientation, and we traced how different emotional registers were associated with downstream engagement. The pattern is consistent and practically significant. Sympathy and solidarity framing are associated with higher levels of productive action orientation, while panic-heavy discourse is associated with reduced engagement with actionable information. These findings suggest that platform amplification dynamics can privilege emotional intensity over practical usefulness, complicating efforts to maintain effective crisis information environments.</p> <h2 id="digital-resilience-agenda">Digital Resilience Agenda</h2> <p>The two strands of this project converge on a single underlying question: what does it take to remain adaptive — cognitively, socially, emotionally — in a world where the primary medium of daily life is also actively shaping what you notice, who you trust, and how you feel?</p> <p>The concept of <strong>digital resilience</strong> captures this capacity. It is not simply a matter of limiting screen time or using media “wisely” in some abstract sense. It is a structural property, distributed unequally across the population, and built from identifiable components: access to diverse, high-quality information networks; the habit of active rather than passive platform engagement; sustained offline social ties that are not fully mediated by algorithmic systems; and the ability to regulate emotional responses to digital content under stress. Users who possess these resources are better positioned to navigate crises without being overwhelmed by panic or gradually cocooned into passivity. Those who lack them are more vulnerable on both timescales — the slow drift and the sudden shock.</p> <p>What this means for platform design, public communication, and digital literacy education is a question this project continues to pursue. The goal is not to make people use less technology, but to understand the conditions under which technology use makes people more capable of living well together — and to advocate for those conditions by evidence.</p> <h2 id="research-contributions-and-next-steps">Research Contributions and Next Steps</h2> <p>This project reframes digital risk as a resilience problem across two timescales. On the slow timescale, it identifies how passive, recommendation-driven use predicts contraction in behavioral diversity (the behavior cocoon), while active and socially reciprocal use shows more protective patterns <a class="citation" href="#yan2025cocoon">(Yan et al., 2025)</a>. On the fast timescale, it shows that emotional framing in crisis communication is not neutral: sympathy and solidarity tend to support prosocial action, while panic-heavy environments can suppress effective response <a class="citation" href="#zhang2025emotion">(Zhang et al., 2025)</a>.</p> <p>The next step is translational: converting these findings into testable design and policy levers. Ongoing work examines platform-level frictions that can diversify routines without harming usability, and crisis-messaging protocols that preserve urgency while reducing emotional overload. The broader objective is to move from post-hoc diagnosis to preventive media design that supports adaptive behavior under both routine and shock conditions.</p> <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2> <p>This project draws on panel surveys and experience-sampling methods for behavioural diversity measurement, entropy-based indices of daily activity variety, structural equation modelling and multilevel longitudinal analysis, large-scale computational analysis of Chinese social-media corpora, automated sentiment and emotion classification, and content coding of crisis communication posts.</p> </article> <h2>References</h2> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2025</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Commun.</abbr> <figure> <picture> <img src="/al-folio/assets/img/publication_preview/yan2025cocoon.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="yan2025cocoon.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="yan2025cocoon" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Who Weaved My Behavior Cocoon?
