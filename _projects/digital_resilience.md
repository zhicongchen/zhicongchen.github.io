## Research at a Glance

| Topic | Data and Methods | Main Finding | Key Papers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Behavior cocoon and daily activity structure | UK Time Use Survey, panel-style temporal analysis, behavioral diversity metrics | Digital media use for work and leisure shows different associations with cocoon formation; work-life balance moderates the pattern. | {% cite yan2025cocoon %} |
| Emotion dynamics in crisis communication | Four-wave social media panel data, fixed-effects modeling | Negative and positive emotion show nonlinear relationships with online donation; panic and sympathy discourse act as moderators. | {% cite zhang2025emotion %} |
| Partisan exposure and conspiracy beliefs | US survey data, regression with interaction analysis | Exposure to conservative media and far-right sites is associated with stronger COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, with political-identity heterogeneity. | {% cite yu2024conspiracy %} |
| Authoritarian personality and policy attitudes | ANES 2020 data, mediation analysis | Authoritarian personality has an indirect pathway to gun-control attitudes through partisan media exposure. | {% cite jiang2025authoritarian %} |
| Collective attention foundations | Computational communication modeling | Early work on collective attention flow informs current social-sensing and exposure-pathway measurement. | {% cite wang2017collectiveattention %} |

## Methods Stack

| Category | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| Inference | Fixed-effects and multilevel models, mediation designs |
| Computation | Social sensing pipelines, NLP-based emotion and discourse measurement |
| Data | Time-use surveys, social media panel data, national survey datasets |

## Program Direction

- Estimate how attention shocks and exposure pathways influence information vulnerability over time.
- Integrate emotion, discourse, and behavioral signals into unified resilience measurement frameworks.
- Connect platform-level dynamics to broader indicators of collective response in crisis and policy contexts.
