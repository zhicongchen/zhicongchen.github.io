## Research at a Glance

| Topic | Data and Methods | Main Finding | Key Papers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tor adoption and knowledge accumulation | Country-level panel data, search-trace modeling | Tor uptake is associated with motivation and how-to knowledge, with political-context differences in usage patterns. | {% cite chen2024tor %} |
| Sustainability in anonymous communities | Dark Web and Surface Web forum traces, survival analysis, NLP | Anonymous forums show distinct interaction and sustainability dynamics; language-use patterns are associated with retention and exit. | {% cite chen2025twin chen2023darkweb %} |
| Dark-side platform use and misinformation beliefs | US survey data, matching and IV robustness checks | Dark-side platform use is positively associated with misinformation beliefs in public-health and electoral contexts. | {% cite chen2025darkside %} |

## Methods Stack

| Category | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| Inference | Panel models, survival analysis, matching and instrumental-variable designs |
| Computation | NLP, behavioral trace analytics, network analysis |
| Data | Cross-national traces, online community logs, survey datasets |

## Program Direction

- Track cross-platform risk transfer between hidden networks and mainstream platforms using longitudinal designs.
- Develop stronger causal and early-warning models for misinformation, fraud, and security-relevant discourse.
- Expand comparative analyses across languages, communities, and platform governance regimes.
